2025/12/21, Type: Gh, File: [Gh]()

## Application Modes

- **Cold udon (zaru, bukkake)**
    
    Focus on firmness, surface smoothness, and dipping efficiency.
    
- **Hot broth udon (kake, kitsune)**
    
    Emphasis on heat retention and structural stability.
    
- **Stirred / mixed udon**
    
    Requires durability against mechanical mixing.
    
- **Topping-dense udon**
    
    Noodle acts as structural base for load-bearing ingredients.

## Scalability Notes

- Noodle geometry scales independently from serving context.
- Applications change without modifying the core system.
- Production volume scales linearly; performance remains predictable.
- Udon functions as a platform, not a final product.
