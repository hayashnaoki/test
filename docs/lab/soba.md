# Soba

### Open-Source Soba Project

**Project Title:** Scalable Soba

**Scope:** Cold or hot soba noodles as a reproducible, scalable system

---

## Concept

Soba is a system defined by ratio, time, and flow. Flour composition, hydration, rolling thickness, and boiling time determine quality. These parameters scale linearly, making soba suitable as an open, reproducible food system—small batch or large volume, same rules.

## Build Steps

1. **Define ratios**
    
    Set flour ratio (e.g. 80% buckwheat / 20% wheat). Scale quantities linearly.
    
2. **Mix dough**
    
    Gradually add water until dough holds together.
    
3. **Knead & rest**
    
    Knead until smooth. Rest briefly to stabilize structure.
    
4. **Roll**
    
    Roll dough to uniform thickness. Thickness directly controls cooking time and texture.
    
5. **Cut**
    
    Cut into consistent-width noodles. Precision improves scalability.
    
6. **Boil**
    
    Boil in large volumes of water. Batch size scales with pot capacity.
    
7. **Rinse / serve**
    
    Rinse for cold soba or transfer directly to broth for hot soba.
    
8. **Finish**
    
    Serve with tsuyu, toppings, and condiments.

## Scalability Notes

- Ingredient ratios scale linearly.
- Thickness and cut width are fixed parameters.
- Cooking time remains constant per noodle cross-section.
- Output volume is limited only by workspace and boiling capacity.
