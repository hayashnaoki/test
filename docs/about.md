# Naoki Hayashi

Industrial / Computational designer / Maker

I am an industrial and computational sushi designer, focused on systems that scale with precision and intent. Sushi is not defined by complexity, but by balance—materials, proportions, and repeatable processes. This perspective directly informs my design approach.

My work combines industrial design, parametric modeling, and digital fabrication to translate simple rules into consistent, scalable outcomes. I value clarity in structure, reproducibility in making, and the ability for a design to adapt without losing its essence.
