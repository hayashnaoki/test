Note: Sometimes css changes take time. Be patient...  
Links like `[name](projects/page.md)` work after pushing, but <u>won't work during local preview.</u>

{: .warning}
Links like `[name](/test/docs/projects/page)` work.  
Always write **<u>absolute link</u>** and **<u>avoid suffix</u>** like `.md`.
